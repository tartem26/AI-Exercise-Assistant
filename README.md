# AI-Exercise-Assistant
AI Exercise Assistant is a webcam-based computer vision project that analyzes exercise form in real time. Using MediaPipe Pose and OpenCV, it extracts landmarks, computes joint angles, and flags form errors with on-screen cues. Includes configurable angle thresholds, rep counting, and per-exercise rules (plank, lunges, shoulder press).
